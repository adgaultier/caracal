Caracal is a rust implementation of known eBPF [techniques](#sources) that: 
- hide target bpf programs & maps   ‚Üí won't be visible with `bpftop`, `bpftool` ...
- hide target processes            ‚Üí won't be visible with `ps`, `top`, `procs`, `ls /proc` ...

<br>

It targets specifically `bpf` and `getdents64` syscalls



## üöÄ Setup

You need a Linux based OS.

### ‚öíÔ∏è Build from source

To build from source, make sure you have:

- [bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker) installed.
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed with `nightly` toolchain.


#### 1. Build ebpf program

```
cd caracal-ebpf && cargo build  --release
```

#### 2. Build user space program
```
cargo build --release 
```
This command will produce  `caracal` executable in `target/release` that you can add to your`$PATH`


### üì• Binary release

You can download the pre-built binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/adgaultier/caracal/releases)
<br>

## ü™Ñ Usage
Run `caracal` with  root privileges:

```
caracal --pid <pids> --bpf-prog-id <bpf-ids>
```
- `<pids>`: List of process IDs to hide (comma-separated, e.g., 123,456)
- `<bpf-ids>`: List of eBPF program IDs to hide (comma-separated, e.g., 789,101)


Example:
```
RUST_LOG=info sudo -E caracal --pid $PPID,1337  --bpf-prog-id  23,24,26
```

will hide:
- `caracal` launching process & its children
- 1337 process & its children
- `caracal` eBPF program & maps
- 23,24,26 eBPF programs & maps
